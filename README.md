# Changes in Bicycle Riding Patterns and Riders between 2019 and 2020

## Goal
This study compared bicycle riding patters and riders’ characteristics in May, 2019 and those in May 2020.

## Method
JC-201905-citibike-tripdata and JC-202005-citibike-tripdata were downloaded from  the Citi Bike Data webpage. These data were joined on Start Station IDs because I planned to perform  the start-station-level analysis -- the riding patterns and riders' characteristics at each station were compared. 

## Summary 

Overall, the start stations of the bicycle riders seem to be concentrated in the central city areas (Zip code areas, 07302 and 07303). The number of bicycle riders tend to be larger in these areas than the areas surrounding them. This pattern appears to be consistent across different years. (see Overall Starting Stations and their Zip Codes map)

However, there are some changes in the numbers of riders, duration of riding, and where they ride in 2020. The total number of riders per month decreased, but the duration became longer than 2019. This tendency is particularly noticeable at the starting stations located near the parks. The age groups of the riders at these stations also seem to have changed: the riders age 45 -65 were added in 2020 to those age 25 – 45 who seem to be the majority of riders in 2019.

There is no data available at this point that can be used to explain why these changes have happened in 2020. However, it might be reasonable to assume the impacts of social distancing order and company / school closure in 2020. For example, many people might have stayed home and did not ride outside, which could have resulted in reducing the number of riders in 2020. People age 45-65 who usually work in the offices might have joined the riders at the parks since their offices were closed. Further research needs to be conducted for supporting these hypotheses.

## Details

**Increased Riders, Increased Duration**

*Referring to [“Top 20 Start Stations and Riders” chart](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mika.nagamine#!/vizhome/Tauleau_homework_Workbook_15932499393900/Top20_Riders), [“Popular Starting Stations” map](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mika.nagamine#!/vizhome/Tauleau_homework_Workbook_15932499393900/Popular_Starting_Stations) and [“Top 20 Start Stations and Duration” chart](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mika.nagamine#!/vizhome/Tauleau_homework_Workbook_15932499393900/Top20_Duration)*

* Overall, the numbers of riders at the majority of stations were larger in 2019 than in 2020. This pattern was noticeable with more centrally located starting stations.

* One of the centrally located stations, Grove St. PATH station, had more than 4,000 riders per month (May) in 2019, but only about 1,000 riders in 2020.

* A few start stations located near the parks increased the number of riders in 2020.

  * Liberty Light Rail station located near the Liberty State Park had 2.6 times more riders per month (May) in 2020 than 2019.

* Overall, the duration of bicycle riding increased in 2020.

  * In 2019, the maximum duration of riding from starting to stopping per month was less than 40 minutes at Liberty Light Rail station. The maximum duration at the same station presented about 100 minutes. 

* Starting stations that Increased the number of riders and increased the duration in 2020 (Liberty Light Rail, Newport Pkwy, JC Medical Center) seem to be located near the parks (Liberty State Park, Newport Green Park). 

**Age Groups of Riders and the peak time of riding**

*Referring to [“Generations of Riders” chart](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mika.nagamine#!/vizhome/Tauleau_homework_Workbook_15932499393900/Generations) and [“Peak Hours of Riding” chart](https://public.tableau.com/profile/mika.nagamine#!/vizhome/Tauleau_homework_Workbook_15932499393900/Peak_Riding_Hours):*

* Age distributions of riders in 2020 changed at the starting stations located near the parks (Liberty Light Rail and Lincoln Park). In 2019, riders at these stations tended to be those age between 24 and 45 (birth years between 1996 and 1975) . However, in May 2020, these stations included the riders who were age between 45 and 65 (birth years between 1975 and 1955) and those age between 18 and 22 (birth years between 2002 and 2006), in addition to those between 24-45.

* The times within a day that people were riding were afternoon, particularly between 3 PM to 6 PM in these parks. There was no such pattern in 2019 (except at 2PM at Liberty Light Rail station).
